                In 2010, rockstar games released a western story game. That game was the iconic and incredible red dead redemption.
                It was revolutionary for its time and paved the way for the current landscape of videogames. 8 years on the sequel
                to Red dead redemption released and that game is red dead redemption 2. Although ot is called a sequel, it is actually
                a prequel to red dead redemption. It follows an outlaw in a gang called Arthur Morgan. He is in the same gang as the
                protaganist of the last game John Marston. The gang was heavely talked about in the game but remained a mystery,
                only hearing breif points about it. It follows the gang an there adventures and chalenges. It has an incredible story
                and bueatiful graphics. I would rate this game a 5/5 and an experience I would reccomend to everyone
