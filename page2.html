                In 2020, Bethesda released the sequel to Doom 2016. This release was extremly anticipated and it managed to
                live up to the hype. Doom Eternal is a first person shooter where you play as the Doom guy fighting through
                the forces of hell and killing demons to save earth form being taken over by the forces of sin. Doom Eternal
                is an extremly fast paced game with fluid movement and incredible graphics paired with it. It won many award 
                for its outstanding features and is clear to see why it is so highly acclaimed amongst fans and critics.
                Also being avaliable on multiple platforms allows consumers from all corners of the world with whatever platform
                the consumer plays the game and experience this incredible game. I would rate this game a 4.5/5 and a great time 
                for people that like fast paced games.
